# libpg_query-sys

This crate provides FFI bindings to
[libpg_query](https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query).

## Building Against the System Library

By default, this library builds against a version of the C library that it has
vendored. However, if you set the `LIBPG_QUERY_PATH` env var when running
`cargo`, it will use this path to find the needed header and library
files. Specifically, it will look for `$LIBPG_QUERY_PATH/include/pg_query.h`
and look in `$LIBPG_QUERY_PATH/lib` for the compiled library.
